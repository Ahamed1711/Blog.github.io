    <p>India has given to the world many a great cricketer
        but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli.
        To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the 
       technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and 
       fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the 
       world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became 
       the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time,
        making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, 
       in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs.
        Plenty of them.
       This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy
        he demanded more than ever of his bowlers especially
        the quick ones, often sacrificed a batsman for bowling depth,
        and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in Test rankings and a
        first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on his way to
        end up as India's most successful Test captain.
       Barring one in Bangladesh, Kohli scored Test hundreds
        in and against every country he played. He absolutely 
       smashed records for number of matches taken to reach
        eight, nine, ten and eleven thousand ODI runs. He was 
       a genuine threat to Sachin Tendulkar's record of 49 ODI
        and 51 Test hundreds.
       An Under-19 world Cup-winning captain, when he burst
        onto the scene, Kohli was a precocious talent with a cover
        drive to kill for. He was destined to be India's next big 
       batsman as the Tendulkar era began to retire, but Kohli 
       wanted to be more: a cricketer whom the opposition would
        be in awe of, a cricketer whose presence would raise the
        intensity of the contest. He lived every ball, competed each 
       moment, and made sure he had the fitness and strength to
        do so. He was widely credited for changing the fitness 
       culture in Indian cricket, introducing endurance tests as a 
       criterion for selection.
       Kohli was quite simply India's most powerful captain. 
       Centre of every marketing campaign for Indian cricket, 
       he also happened to lead at a time when the BCCI was 
       run by interim administrators who knew better than to
        draw the ire of Indian cricket's biggest star. There was 
       never any cause to doubt his intent to do things that 
       will win matches for India, which they did plenty under him.
